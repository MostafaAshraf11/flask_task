While natural processes can contribute to climate change, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial practices are the primary drivers of the current global warming trends. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, which trap heat and raise the planet's average temperature. As a result, the Earth's climate is becoming warmer, leading to rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. Addressing climate change requires global efforts, including reducing carbon emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.\"\r\n}",
